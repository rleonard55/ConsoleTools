# ConsoleTools
I wanted to create a “single” class that could be added to a WinForm or Console application to allow for a rich user interaction typical with other command line tools. I wanted it to be as simple as “Copy Paste” to add this functionality to an existing project with little to no impact on the business classes within the code base. 
If anyone finds this useful please drop me a line. Pulls are welcomed, particularly if you would like to contribute.
